In this chapter, we are going to have a detailed look at the food that we supply to our bodies, however, we are going to use a chemical engineering approach where we break down all the chemical elements that enter our bodies through food.

In the overall reaction water might be a product (or reactant) and this will be calculated in the mass balance. Understand that a major amount of water will enter the system as well as exit the system and that this amount is not quantified. Only a small amount of water will either be used from the incoming water stream or will be produced and added to the outgoing water stream.

We will also require oxygen as final electron acceptor from oxidative phosphorilation, so this is an additional stream into the process. When we consider the streams that exit the body (or system) it is obvious that COâ‚‚ must leave the system when we consider the formation of COâ‚‚ in the TCA cycle. In addition our food and liquid consumption generate a solid waste stream (feces) and a liquid waste stream (urine). Since we will be working with annimal manure in the next chapters we prefer to use the term humanure for solid waste generated from humans, it just sounds better than all the other terms avaialble. There is of course other small excretion streams like sweat, tears, mucus and hair but the amount of chemicals contained in these excretions are relatively insignificant compared to the main streams mentioned above, so for keeping the mass balance simple we will ignore these terms.The following diagram will help:\n",

We already have the elemental composition of the food intake, but in order to complete the mass balance we need elemental compositions (and some flowrates) of the urine and humanure stream.

    "## Stoichiometry, rates and yields\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subject it is crucial to understand how stoichiometry relates to reaction rates. Let's start by considering a simple chemical reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A+2B \\to 4C+3D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In essense this reaction states that for each mole of A that reacts, 2 moles of B is consumed, while 4 moles of C is formed and 3 moles of D is formed. In the context of this subject it is the easiest to think of reaction in terms of reaction rates where we relate the conversion process to time. In terms of the reaction rate ($r_i$) we can use the stoichiometric coeffisients to relate the respective reaction rates of the 4 components to one another. It should be clear that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_B=2r_A, \\,\\, r_C=-4r_A, \\,\\, r_D=-3r_A  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The standard convention** is to define production rate as positive. This implies that $r_A$ and $r_B$ will be negative since molecules are consumed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reaction above can also be written as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{2}A+B \\to 2C+\\frac{3}{2}D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have chosen to relate the stoichiometry to one mole of B that reacts (instead of one mole of A that reacts in the fisrt expression). It should be clear to you that the following relationships applies for both ways of expressing the reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\frac{-r_B}{-r_A}=2  \\;\\; \\frac{r_C}{-r_A}=4 \\;\\; \\frac{r_D}{-r_A}=3  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is preferable to put minus sings in front of reagent reaction rates in order to work with positive quatities. The relationships above show that stoichiometry is merely the ratio of rates. We can write out the reaction like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A+\\left(\\frac{-r_B}{-r_A}\\right)B \\to \\left(\\frac{r_C}{-r_A}\\right)C+\\left(\\frac{r_D}{-r_A}\\right)D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above expression component A was chosen as the basis (by assigning a coeffisient of 1). We can for example opt to have component C as the basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left(\\frac{-r_A}{r_C}\\right)A+\\left(\\frac{-r_B}{r_C}\\right)B \\to C+\\left(\\frac{r_D}{r_C}\\right)D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the stoichiometric coeffisients might change, but the ratio between the coeffisients don't. To simplify all the ratios we can merely write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (-r_A) A+(-r_B) B \\to (r_C) C+(r_D)D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It might appear that we now need 4 stoichiometric coeffisients to define the reaction. We only need 3 since stoichiometry only defines the ratios in which the components react. For 4 components there is just 3 independant ratios. If the absolute value of one reaction rate is known, the 3 independant stoichiometric coeffisients will allow the calculation of all the rate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bioprocess nomenclature, stoichiometric coeffisients are referred to as **yield coeffisients ($Y$)**. If component A is chosen as the basis, the above reaction will be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  A+Y_{AB} B \\to Y_{AC} C+Y_{AD}D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also for example use C as the basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  Y_{CA}A+Y_{CB} B \\to  C+Y_{CD}D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the simple relatioship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_{AC}=\\frac{r_C}{-r_A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The convention explained above exclusively works with **positive values of rates and yields**. The underlying assumption is that it is known whether a component is a reagent or a product. Negative yield or rate values will imply that a component was incorrectly identified as reagent/product. "
