    "Hopefully it reminds you of the respiration videos in chapter 1. We won't be getting into metabolic detail of the process of photosyntheis, but it is very interesting to note that photosyntheis is really the reverse reaction of aerobic respiration. But more about this later. Let's rather look at the picture above a bit more. Can you see the phospholipids that constitutes the membrane? Do you know the chemical composition of this membrane? There is a lot of 'insertions' in the membrane. These are all spesialised proteins that facilitate the process of capturing sunlight and turning it into ATP. We are not going deep into the mechanism of this process, we are rather interested into how these specialised proteins are made. The short answer to this question is that DNA contains the recipes to produce all the proteins that the organims requires, this is referred to as the central dogma of biology. Before we can understand the dogma we nee some background on nucluic acids:\n",

    "So now we at least know how proteins get made and hopefully soon you will understand how the proteins responsible for fotosynthesis are absolutely essential for life on earth. The sun is the great energy source and fotosynthesis is the great capturer that converts light energy into chemical energy. Do you understand that all fossil fuels are derived fron ancient plant material? [Climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) is really a result of humans burning 'ancient sunlight'. It is highly unsustainable since the rate of $CO_2$ capture by 'current sunlight' is not nearly as fast as the release of $CO_2$ from 'ancient sunlight'. Ensure that you understand this principle. \n",

The accumulation of oxygen into the atmosphere, caused by cyanobacteria is sometimes referred to as the [great oxygenation event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event). All eukaryotes basically developed because of oxygen availability. Once evolution discovered aerobic respiration the path was set for the the development of [multicellular organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism), given that much bigger quantities of ATP could be generated with the avaialbility of oxygen. Of course, cyanobacteria preceded the invention of aerobic respiration because oxygen had to accumulate in the atmosphere first. \n",

    "It is now time to look beyond the CHON elements in Ben's food. In CBI310 we'll use only the additional elements of sulphur, phorphorous, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Please note that other elements are also present but typically in smaller quantities. It is important to understand that the minerals will contribute to the mass of the biomass, although not a lot. Given that all our work upto now was only based on the CHON fraction of the mass, it is important to understand that a fraction of mass should be added in order to obtain the total dry mass of food according to the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Total \\, dry \\, mass=Mass \\, of\\, CHON+ Mass\\, of \\, SPKCaMg$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M_T = M_{CHON}+M_{SPKCaMg}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the formula above and only using SPKCaMg as additional elements, determine the total mass entering the system. Also determine the fraction of $M_{CHON}$ of the total mass $M_{T}$."
